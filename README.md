# LearningSTL

LearningSTL is a personal project aimed at deepening my understanding of C++ Standard Template Library (STL) by studying and emulating the structure and implementation of the [MyTinySTL](https://github.com/Alinshans/MyTinySTL) project.

## Introduction

This project is not intended for production use but as a learning exercise. It is a way for me to explore the intricacies of the C++ language and the design of a library that has become a standard tool in modern C++ development.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the original MyTinySTL project and its contributors. The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/Alinshans/MyTinySTL).
